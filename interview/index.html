	<h2>Franki: Where do you find inspiration and how?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Zara: Travelling is what inspires me the most. The scenery, culture and overall experience. I usually check out the artwork wherever I am and learn about the different styles from different places. I like to keep a journal with me and write down everything and anything. Also photos, lots of photos and from the two I can usually think of an interesting subject for my next project.</p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2> F: What projects are you most proud of and why?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: I like my abstract paintings because they always turn out better than I expect them to. It’s interesting to see how others perceive it as well since it can be looked at in so many different ways. No plan, just seeing where the brush takes me when it hits the page.</p> 
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: Take me through your creative process.</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: It usually starts with a rough idea and from there I sketch as much as I can to expand my thoughts. Sketches become more defined and once I am happy I take it to the next stage.</p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: What is your dream job and why?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: Anything in the art field would be ideal. Photographer, designer, artist. Since it’s something I am passionate about I think it wouldn’t even feel like much of a job.</p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: What is you media of choice?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: Probably paint. Oil or acrylic but I also love the freedom that comes with watercolour. </p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: Favourite type of webpage when it comes to design?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: I like the layout of Instagram, I find it very easy to control and clean. I also like how it allows you to build your own aesthetic. Some people you click on their page and feel like you know exactly how they are as a person. Content wise I find Tumblr has very unique photos and ideas.</p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: Have you thought about working digitally?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: Yes I’ve tried it out before, I think that is where I plan to take the next step with my artwork. I am still unfamiliar with all the softwares but I have tried Photoshop. I’ve also used many different photo editing sites if that counts.</p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: Do you think you could see yourself in Web Design?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: The design part of it yes. I would love to design how the page itself looks but when it comes to the tech part of it I would need a lot of help. If I was just in charge of the appearance part and someone could actually put it together then potentially that could work.</p> 
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>F: Any last thoughts or advice for future designers?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>Z: Don’t be so hard on yourself. There is always going to be someone you think is better and in this field you are constantly comparing your work to others and it can be quite intimidating at times. But everyone has their own style and process. Just keep trying and working hard and you’ll be surprised with what you can come up with.</p>
